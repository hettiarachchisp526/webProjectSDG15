                      <p>Despite its small size, Sri Lanka is home to 248 butterfly species â€“ 31 of which are endemic, which means they are only found in Sri Lanka. Common species are found across the island, but other species are found only in specific habitats.</p>

                      <p>Fifty-two species of butterflies have been recorded from Wasgamuwa with eight endemic species, however, a comprehensive study of butterflies in Wasgamuwa is yet to be carried out, so this list may well be a lot longer. Our project aims to fill this knowledge gap, create a sanctuary for butterflies, and launch a public awareness programme to teach local children about butterfly species, the threats to their survival and how to conserve them.

                  </p>
                  <p>1.	Assessing and documenting terrestrial and aquatic habitat/ ecosystem types found within the Heladhanavi property.<br/></p>

                  <p>3.	Documenting species richness of vertebrate fauna and selected invertebrate fauna in the different habitats/ecosystems within the Heladhanavi property.<br/></p>
                  <p>4.	Identifying nationally threatened, endemic and invasive faunal and floral species found within the Heladhanavi property.<br/></p>
