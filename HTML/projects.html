        <h3><br>Sri Lanka's carnivores are under threat, yet many still remain unstudied in the Wasgamuwa area.</h3>

            We are partnering with the Society for the Preservation of Endangered Carnivores
             & their International Ecological Study (S.P.E.C.I.E.S.) to uncover the secret world of Sri Lanka's 
             medium-large mammal communities. 
            
            Work is currently underway to survey and evaluate the status of seven carnivore species, including the 
            sloth bear, leopard, rusty-spotted cat, fishing cat, jungle cat, golden palm civet, and Sri Lankan jackal, 
            using the help of our Volunteer Programme.
           
            <h3><br>We've partnered with Spa Ceylon to protect Sri Lanka's indigenous and endemic butterfly species, 
                promoting biodiversity conservation.</h3>

<p>Despite its small size, Sri Lanka is home to 248 butterfly species â€“ 31 of which are endemic, which means they are only found 
in Sri Lanka. Common species are found across the island, but other species are found only in specific habitats.</p>
 
<p>Fifty-two species of butterflies have been recorded from Wasgamuwa with eight endemic species, however, a comprehensive study 
of butterflies in Wasgamuwa is yet to be carried out, so this list may well be a lot longer. Our project aims to fill this knowledge 
gap, create a sanctuary for butterflies, and launch a public awareness programme to teach local children about butterfly species, 
the threats to their survival and how to conserve them.</p>

  Assessing biodiversity surrounding the Heladhanavi power plant.
  <h4><br>Project title:</h4>Assessing the status of the
   biodiversity of the rainwater harvesting systems of Heladhanavi Power Plant and its surroundings
  <h4><br>Location:</h4>Puttalam, Sri Lanka
  <h4><br>Objectives of the project:</h4>The main objective of the project
   was to better understand the ecosystem and biodiversity of the land in order to
    decide on alternate uses of the land, preferably a nature-based tourism activity. The study entailed:
<ol>
  <li>Assessing and documenting terrestrial and aquatic habitat/ecosystem types found within the Heladhanavi property</li>
  <li>Assessing and documenting structure and composition of vegetation types within the Heladhanavi site</li>
  <li>Documenting species richness of vertebrate fauna and selected invertebrate fauna in the different 
    habitats/ecosystems within the Heladhanavi property</li>
  <li>Identifying nationally threatened, endemic and invasive faunal and floral species found within the Heladhanavi property</li>
</ol>

    <P>Prior to the 1980s, the need for an organization dedicated solely to protecting the 
        environment in Sri Lanka had long existed. Environmental Foundation Limited (EFL) was born in 1981 and 
        later incorporated under the Companies Act (Guarantee) Limited.</P>

      <p>Sri Lanka Wilderness Foundation is an organization dedicated to the conservation of deserts 
          in Sri Lanka through education and sustainable tourism development. Their Responsible Tourism 
          Division - Eco Team has been spearheading projects at 24 locations islandwide since 2000, all of which are 
          coordinated and carried out by SLWF.</p>
