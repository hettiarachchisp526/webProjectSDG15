                    <p>Also, after uploading the photos, one of the important steps we have taken to prevent the photos from being unnecessarily posted on social media is to allow a limited number of people to be aware of the details of the photos here. That is, only for those who are engaged in environmental work. Through them, necessary measures are taken to protect those anmals & plants , and they also carry out social awareness.</p>
